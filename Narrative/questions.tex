\section{Open questions}
Open questions relevant to this work include:

\begin{itemize}
 \item What level of granularity is needed for the collected data?   The size of the data depends on the level of granularity and the level of granularity depends on the characteristics of the application.  For some applications, communication contributes significantly to latency, while for others I/O is the bottleneck. 
\item How can we scale the information collection without increasing overhead too much? Collecting a complete holistic view of the environment during runtime is important. However, if the overhead of capturing that information is too high,
then the net gain would be too small to justify online analysis. 
\item How long should we maintain the collected data?
\item Which conferences/workshops should be targeted to publish impactful papers on this work?
\end{itemize}
