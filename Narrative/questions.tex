\section{Open questions}
Some research questions that are relevant to this year's work:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Level of granularity of collected data: This is an important research question for performance analysis tools. Size of data depends on the level of granularity.  And this level depends on the needs of each application, for some applications communication contributes significantly to latency, while for others, I/O is the bottleneck. 
\item Scalability of introspection: How to scale the information collection without putting too much over head? Collecting a complete holistic view of the environment during runtime is important. However, if the overhead is too much , then the net gain at the end would be too small which can kill the idea of online analysis. 
\item Maintainability of data: How long should we maintain the collected data and when?
\item Potential publications: We are aiming to publish research papers in refereed conferences/workshops based on this year work.

\end{itemize}
