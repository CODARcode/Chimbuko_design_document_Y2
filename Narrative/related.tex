Workflows are taking an increasingly important role in orchestrating complex scientific processes in extreme scale and highly heterogeneous environments. However, to date we cannot reliably predict, understand, and optimize workflow performance. Sources of performance variability and in particular the inter-dependencies of workflow design, execution environment and system architecture are not well understood. While there is a rich portfolio of tools for performance analysis~\cite{sonar, TAU, ScoreP, HPCToolkit} modeling and prediction for single applications in homogeneous computing environments, these are not applicable to workflow, due to the number and heterogeneity of the involved workflow and system components and theirs strong interdependencies. In addition, there is currently no tool that tracks the performance of workflow components as it relates to provenance. A literature review to support these claims has been published in~\cite{kerstin2015design}.
