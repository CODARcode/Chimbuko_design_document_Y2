\section{Related work}

Workflows are increasingly important in orchestrating complex scientific processes in extreme scale and highly heterogeneous environments. To date, however, we cannot reliably predict, understand, and optimize workflow performance. Sources of performance variability and in particular the interdependencies of workflow design, execution environment, and system architecture are not well understood. While there is a rich portfolio of tools for performance analysis~\cite{sonar, TAU, ScoreP, HPCToolkit} modeling and prediction for single applications in homogeneous computing environments, these are not sufficient for workflows, due to the number and heterogeneity of the involved workflow and system components and their strong interdependencies. In addition, no tool currently tracks the performance of workflow components as it relates to provenance. A literature review to support these claims has been published~\cite{kerstin2015design}.
