\section{Stakeholders}

\subsection{ECP Applications}
Stakeholders include scientific applications that are part of the ECP program. We have consulted many and received positive feedback regarding the usefulness to them of a system such as Chimbuko. ECP applications that exhibit unexplained variability in performance, strong data reduction needs, and different types of workflows are poised to benefit from the Chimbuko technology.

\subsection{Software Technologies}					
ECP software technology  projects such as ADIOS, Cinema, Swift, SZ, and ZFP are all potential contributors of software components that may be integrated into the Chimbuko framework.

%%%% TSM:
%%%% Candle -- this is an application development project
%%%% Spack -- package manager; not clear they will provide technology to Chimbuko
