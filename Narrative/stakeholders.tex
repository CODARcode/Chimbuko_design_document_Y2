\section{Stakeholders}

\subsection{ECP Applications}
Stakeholders include scientific applications that are part of the ECP program. We have consulted many and received positive feedback regarding the usefulness to them of a system such as Chimbuko. ECP applications that exhibit unexplained variability in performance, strong data reduction needs, and different types of workflows are poised to benefit from the Chimbuko technology.

\subsection{Software Technologies}					
Other systems in the CODAR project, including ADIOS, SWIFT, Savannah, and Cheetah, are potential stakeholders.  ECP software technology  projects such as SZ, ZFP, Cinema,  Candle and Spack are all potential contributors of software components that may be integrated into the Chimbuko framework.
