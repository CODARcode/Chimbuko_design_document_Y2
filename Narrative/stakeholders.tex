\section{Stakeholders}

\subsection{ECP Applications}
Stakeholders include scientific applications that are part of the ECP program. We have consulted many and received positive feedback regarding the usefulness to them of a system such as Chimbuko. ECP applications that exhibit unexplained variability in performance, strong data reduction needs, and different types of workflows are poised to benefit from the Chimbuko technology.

\subsection{Software Technologies}					
 ECP software technology  projects such as ADIOS, Swift, SZ, ZFP, Cinema,  Candle and Spack are all potential contributors of software components that may be integrated into the Chimbuko framework.
