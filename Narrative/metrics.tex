\section{Success metrics}

The online version of Chimbuko provides a runtime view of different features important to complex scientific simulations and workflows. This information will allow us to manipulate runtime configuration parameters during the execution phase to improve performance of a given workflow a new machines. Our success metrics will be the number of co-design studies and applications that can assess and visualize the performance metrics through Chimbuko.  Another success metrics is our ability to explore the performance of co-design studies by interacting with the visualization interface, which will show the outliers identified, the function call details in a call tree structure, and other information.
