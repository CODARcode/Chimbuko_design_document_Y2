\section{Success metrics}

The purpose of Chimbuko  online mode is to give a runtime view of different features important to complex scientific simulation and workflows. This helps an end user to manipulate different runtime configuration parameters during  the execution phase to improve  performance of a given workflow application particularly on a new Exascale machines. The success metrics  will be the number of applications that  can assess  and visualize the number of  performance metrics through Chimbuko's online mode for performance improvement.
Also, a user's ability to explore the performance by interacting with the visualization interface. Details include workflow overview showing the identified outliers, function call details in a call tree structure, in a timeline format, and other additional representations.
